In this course I learnt to add dynamic elements to my websites with Javascript, to improve my CSS and HTML and learnt more tags and attributes
Still all locally.

**My final project can be seen in the "terere folder"**
It is a simple website about the mate South America's culture, it is pretty fun
To see it just visit this link: *https://fernandoscjunior.github.io/wdd131-TerereWebsite/*
and going to the final project tab.
